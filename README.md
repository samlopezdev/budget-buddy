## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, React, Appwrite, GoogleAuth

This project was made in 48 hours for the 100Devs 2025 hackathon in Febuary! As someone who's always been a penny pincher, I know how incredibly important it is to stay on top of your finances. When people have a clear picture of where every dollar is going, it becomes much easier to save money and take care of themselves and those who matter most.ðŸ’•

## Optimizations

There's a lot of data fetching happening in the app, so Iâ€™d like to add a loading spinner while the data is being fetched. I also think I can clean up the way expenses are added since they're all pretty similar. I might try adding them in a similar way to how they're deleted (which only uses one function). Also, I'd like to have a way to keep track of the user's income because right now, it disappears when the page refreshes.

## Lessons Learned:

During this hackathon, we were challenged to learn as much as we could about Appwrite and what it can do. Appwrite offers a lot of functionality that I didn't get to experiment with in this project, but my initial impression of it is that it's an extremely intuitive way to get a backend setup done very quickly. After getting a brief overview of how it works, I had to quickly figure out how to use it in my project and adapt as needed. For the most part, I focused on using the Databases and Authentication tools for this project.

This was also one of my first projects where I decided to use TypeScript! I've found that it's basically JavaScript with guardrails, and it helped me catch unusual behavior or bugs early on in the process. Can't wait to learn more about it and use it in future projects!
